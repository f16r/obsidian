Principles
1. Communicate efficiently
	1. Explain what you are thinking
2. Scope the problem
3. Drawing (too soon -> you might not understand the problem)
4. Start with a simple design (but mention optimizations)
5. Properly understand the problem
6. Practice
	1. Reduce stress level
7. Explain you thinking
	1. Which database
		1. SQL: Join, Multiple Tables
		2. NoSQL:
		3. BLOP Storage
8. Get comfortable with the math
	1. Assumptions 
		1. One Instance can handle roughly 1000 req/sec
		2. 1bn Queries a day -> traffic for queries 
			1. e.g. avg. 1000/sec
			2. peak 2000/sec
	2. Load balancing based on signals
		1. Bandwidth
		2. CPU utilization
		3. Memory consumption
	3. Units 
		1. kb/mb/gb/tb/pb
		2. Storage bytes / network bits (8 bits -> 1 byte)
9. Drawing
	1. Box, text, arrow
