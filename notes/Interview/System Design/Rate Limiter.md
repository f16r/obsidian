- limits actions a user/system can perform within a specific time frame
	- 429 Too many requests
- Use cases
	- Prevent overload
	- DDoS protection
	- Fair usage
	- Cost management
- First line of defense: Preventing too many requests from the client on the client
	- can be easily bypassed 
- Implementation on server side (usually before actual server in API gateway)
- Popular Rate Limiting Algorithms
	- Token Bucket 
		- bucket gets filled with tokens with steady rate; 
		- a request tries to take a token out of the bucket
			- if token available -> forward request
			- if no token available -> drop request
	- Leaky Bucket
		- Bucket with a specific size gets filled with requests
		- Fixed forwarding rate (emptying bucket)
		- If bucket is full; new requests will be dropped
	- Fixed Window
		- Max. amount of requests inside a fixed interval (e.g. 100 req per full minute)
		- Downside: Burst at boundary (end of previous window/start of next window)
	- Sliding window
		- Max amount of time inside sliding window (e.g. 100 req./ last minute)
- Logging & Alarms to check how often rate limit is hit
